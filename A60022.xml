            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Chriſtian Reader,</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou I mean who art not the nominall, but the reall, not the titular, but the title-inlivening Chriſtian. Whoſe heart knowes the meaning of ſuch a dreadfully glorious, and gloriouſly dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full undertaking, to be called by the name of God. Thou that feareſt the Lord greatly, and art greatly awed at the leaſt of his words. Thou with whom the goodlieſt profeſſion will paſſe but for a guilded formality, that ſuffers it ſelfe to be wanting in morality. As knowing there may be ſome vertues where there is no grace; but there can be no grace where there is not all vertues. As knowing where the choiceſt eminencies of nature come ſhort, their Chriſtianity exceeds; where the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt ends, the Divine begins. He that lives not <hi>ſoberly and righteouſly,</hi> it is impoſſible he ſhud <hi>live godlily.</hi> It is works that muſt juſtifie our faith, as well as faith our works. It is a <hi>Chriſt</hi> of our own making, (and not Jeſus the Son of God) that is <hi>learned</hi> otherwiſe. While we think to be ſaved either by, or without Obedience. The two Rocks whereon the world is Shipwrackt, while the God-inſtructed Chriſtian keeps the narrow Channell. Thou that makeſt more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of, art more watchfull, more carefull of the leaſt ill word, ill thought, then the Chriſtian at large, of all the ill deeds of his whole life. As far more willingly chooſing the bittereſt
<pb facs="tcp:33685:3"/>death, then the ſweeteſt ſin, as knowing thou ſhat find it the end of ſin, that was the beginning of death. Thou that <hi>haſt an abundant entrance adminiſtred to thee, in that ſtraite and narrow way to the Kingdome of Heaven. That haſt all the Commandements of God,</hi> That keepeſt all his wayes (in a Goſpell acceptation) in the uttermoſt latitude, extent and ſpirituality of them, to the very firſt riſing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, and yet haſt an eaſie yoke, a pleaſant burthen: While thou art endeavouring all to the uttermoſt, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denying all thy endeavours. Thou that art a wonder to thy ſelfe, the gazing ſtock of men and Angels: of the congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating joyes of ſome of the calumniating envies of other; while thou art ſo wonderfully and fearefully made! A man of ſuch bleſſed wonders! being a part of that unparalelled Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of the Eternall Wiſdome, the Lord Chriſt. Thou that knoweſt what it is to lie under thoſe preſſing, weighty, and over-bearing apprehenſions, of an infinite Majeſty reſident in the ſoule, cruſhing as it were, and contriting it to the moſt disſhivered minuteſt pieces, while it is ſtill firmly and intirely <hi>fixed</hi> on Him, and with <hi>full purpoſe of heart cleaving to Him,</hi> in ſuch a ſweet and bleſſed repoſe, ſuch a <hi>perfect peace,</hi> that Millions of Millions of <hi>Worlds can neither give thee nor take from thee.</hi> Who at thy worſt (to ſpeak after the manner of men ſince <hi>all</hi> is <hi>good</hi>) thy diſtractedſt condition, as the World calls it, findeſt that reall, ſubſtantiall, that pure, and as I may ſay, infinite comfort in the moſt clouded darke, dejected, diſconſolate hope, that is objected on a ſimple and infinite God, that all the unclean, ſcanty-ſpirited, ſelf-impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned World cannot once conceive at the higheſt of their mad merriments, and madding jollities. That findeſt inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more content in the very longeſt waitings for any the leaſt beam of grace, to be glanced on thee through the face of thy
<pb facs="tcp:33685:3"/>Chriſt, then thou canſt, nay then the jovialleſt themſelves can (while they goe laughing along with the foole to the ſtocks) in the loudeſt blaze of their <hi>crackling,</hi> their dying <hi>Thornes,</hi> that end in a bed of aſhes. When thy ſoule ſhall be repoſed in a bed of ever-flouriſhing, ſoft, and fragrant Roſes. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour whereof, as by a gentle winde from a garden of Spices is conveyed to thy Heaven-travelling ſoule. And hence is it that all the world to thee that liveſt in ſo ſweet and freſh a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, is but a miery and ſtinking City, thou canſt no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, longer then thou haſt a Pomander of this in thy noſtrils. Thou ſincere ſingle-eyed-ſingle-hearted loyall ſoule, whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can pleaſe, and who wilt pleaſe nothing, but thy God. That haſt no affection for thy ſelfe, for any, but what are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to Him, his ſweet and holy command. As having learned the truth, in the power, the love, the life thereof, <hi>doeſt truth, and therefore commeſt to it,</hi> in its ſearchingst diſcoveries, <hi>walkes in it,</hi> rejoyces in it, ſince <hi>thou haſt known it as it is in Him, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, the true and living way.</hi> In which never ſeducing path goe all thy affections, actions, motions. As <hi>holding faſt the faith and love which are in Him, living godly in Him.</hi> In Him doing, being all that thou art. Thou that art of all men moſt like an Hypocrite, while of all thou doſt moſt differ from him. That art as like him to the eye of the world, as a Diamond to a Briſtoll Stone, while thou differeſt from him <hi>toto coelo,</hi> as much as truth from falſehood, good from bad, heaven from hell. Thou that art incouraged by thy diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and furthered by thy ſcandals, and hinderances of Chriſtianity. As knowing that <hi>Difficilia quae pulchra,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things are hard, but when they meet with a man of an excellent ſpirit. And then their very difficulties, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies make them eaſie; becauſe more animate, and intend his
<pb facs="tcp:33685:4"/>ſpirit to their proſecution. As knowing the truth ſincerely, the heart and realitie of Religion, to be ſo much the more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, lovely and choice-worthy, by how much the more faire Commendable and admirable is its counterfeit. As arguing that if Hypocriſie can make ſo goodly and delectable a ſhew, and yet be but a ſhew, what then is that ſinceritie that is the ſubſtance? if that can attaine to ſuch an emminencie, ſuch a glory, and yet be as blacke as Hell to the eyes of the all-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning Sunne, and inherit the place of the <hi>utmoſt</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt darkeneſſe,</hi> what then is this that differs as much from it as God from the devill? Thou who knoweſt no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and ſafer way to humilitie, then that which the world makes to their pride: the conſideration of their owne parts, gifts, indowments, abilities, eminencies whatſoever. As then moſt truly and throughly humbled, when thou riſeſt to thy higheſt ſtation and takeſt the fulleſt view of all thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies. As ſeeing nothing but what thou haſt of him, in him, and for him the onely ground of humilitie becauſe of glory. To ſee thy ſelfe thus and thus richly qualified, and yet to ſee thy ſelfe to be miſerable, poore, blinde, and naked, to have ſo much and yet to have nothing, argueth that the <hi>Candle of God hath ſhined over thy head</hi> in its brighter beames, and <hi>his ſecrets</hi> have dwelt more intimately more abidingly in <hi>thy Tabernacle.</hi> While ſeeing thy ſelfe of the nobleſt ſtocke, of the choyſeſt of nations, as touching learning with the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned'ſt, concerning zeale with the moſt active, touching the righteouſneſſe in the Law, blameleſſe, &amp;c. and yet to treade and trample all theſe things under thy feete, with the utmoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and deteſtation, as the moſt deſpicable droſſe and dunge in compariſon of one thought of revealed Chriſt, that haſt knowne, or rather art knowne of Him that is the onely excellency. I, ſuch a light ſhining in upon the ſoule
<pb facs="tcp:33685:4"/>and out-ſhining the moſt glorious Sunne <hi>even at mid day,</hi> is that which will <hi>caſt</hi> the greateſt Apoſtle <hi>upon his face,</hi> and make him cry out that <hi>he is leſſe then the leaſt of Saints.</hi> And certainly there may be a due and ſelfe-denying acknowledgement of parts, indowments, performances, &amp;c. while there may be an impudently modeſt and ſelfe-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſelfe-denyall; of all the moſt deſperate, the moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hypocriſie. Beſides, for a man to carry himſelfe lowly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedly, diſcontentedly, upon the meere convincements of his defects, and faults, may be meere baſeneſſe and puſilanimitie, that will ſoone upon the leaſt conceit of its owne worth, turne into, and indeed (narrowly looke into) proceeds from, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries along with it, pride and ſelfe-love. Neither is that to bee thought true humilitie that is not a furtherance to thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And the only courſe to keep <hi>from boaſting</hi> being to learn how to know all <hi>of grace, how to glory, boaſt, in the Lord.</hi> We being onely ſo farre humbled as outed of our ſelves, ſo far outed of our ſelves as filled with God; ſo far as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed gloriouſly to condeſcend, to humble himſelfe unto us, and graciouſly to take us up, to advance us into himſelfe. There being nothing that layes the ſoule lower in its owne eyes, then its higheſt exaltation in Gods.

               <p>HUmilitie and grace are commenſurable, take the depth of the one and you have the height, have all the dimentions of the other. <hi>Ex pede Herculem;</hi> So much Humilitie-ſo much Grace-ſo much God; or rather ſo much God-ſo much Grace-ſo much Humility (All our diſpoſings of our ſelves to him being poſt-not prediſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; ſo farre as I ſpread downeward in the roote of my humble faith, ſo much the more nouriſhment I draw; and conſequently thrive in bulke and ſtature towards the full meaſure of perfection in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>We have according as we receive, but we receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our humility-the hollow of the Palme, the capacitie the capability of the hand of faith, therefore we have according to it.</p>
               <p>Againe, Grace is the Indwelling of God in us and Humility the emptying and the unſelfing us of our ſelves, to live in him; looke then as he comes in, (the very firſt forming of grace,) ſo we goe out; and as wee goe out ſo he comes in with a daily and further tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming us into himſelfe. Or thus, Chriſt is the patterne of Humility, but in him dwelleth the fulneſſe of the Godhead, therefore

                     <l>Thc humbleſt man is the moſt gracious man,</l>

               <p>HIgh and happy is that pitch of Chriſtianity that can ſo well reconcile the greateſt of enemies, Life and Death, as that they both friendly take up their lodgings in the ſame Breaſt, and ſee themſelves entertained with the ſame reſpect, at the ſame time, without the leaſt grudging or repining at each other. The heart not vexed with any partiall peremptory deſires of either. But they quietly reſiding in it, and officiouſly waiting on it with a dexterous ſerviceableneſſe, to diſcharge either of their duties according to the good pleaſure of God, ſignified to the God-well-pleaſed ſoule. Then is a Chriſtian like Himſelfe, when he hath that power over himſelfe, as to walke with his life in his hand, as ready at the leaſt ſound of the word given, either to lay it down, or put it up
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33685:33"/>againe in his heart. When he weares it looſe about him like an outer garment, ready to ſlip on and off as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerves. This is the onely man that is fit to Live, who is fit to Die, and fit to Die, who is fit to Live. He that knowes how to Live hereafter is well prepared how to Live here, and hee is not prepared to depart hence, that knowes not how to Live hereafter. He that knowes no difference betwixt earth and heaven, but more and leſſe of God, as he can not but be continually making more after heaven, becauſe after more of God; ſo can he not but be as willing to ſtay on the earth, while it is more agreeable to the will of God which is Himſelf the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of a Chriſtian. Bleſſed! bleſſed ſoule thus ſented in his God! To whom the ſound of the feete of death are delightfull, and the drawing out of his dayes is pleaſant. When the withering'ſt age detaines not too long in life, nor the flouriſhing'ſt youth haſtens too ſoone to death. As he that crowned with all the pomps and pleaſures that the fragrant'ſt, the fertileſt Garden of the world can afford, ſee's nothing in the whole but meere vanity, meere nothingneſſe, leſſe than nothing.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33685:64"/>converſe, to have fellowſhip with ſuch an infinitely ſweete God, the author, the finiſher of our ever infinitely ſweete humilitie; O who would not now humbly act in all, and aske his mirth what Doth it, and account his laughter madneſſe, runnes a round of ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited pleaſure and is not like a line that takes its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending in thee, that conveyes not the ſoule along to thee onely? Who would not Ecco to the command of, Come doe my will, with a readie and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I come I come to doe thy will? If there be any truth even in naturall love, is it not when it not receives for it ſelfe, but doth for its beloved, even to the undergoing the greateſt paine, the loſing of the deareſt life, can na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture live by, doe, die for love, and ſhall not grace make nature ſubſervient to Thee in all theſe? and what ever there may be more then theſe; where can the man finde himſelfe that knowes thee, that loves Thee as he ſhould as hee would! here is the man that ſees ſo much of Heaven that nothing but the love of God can make him meddle with a thought of the earth, while the God-unacquainted ſoule ſees ſo much of earth that nothing but the love of himſelfe can make him to meddle with a thought of heaven; all the glories of the Kingdomes of the world may well paſſe away as ſhaddowes, vanities, nothings before the ſoule that in his Chriſt ſees his God, when the leaſt tempting Apple may looſe him that is not ſecured in this bleſt premunition. And to that happie condition is the ſoule brought, and that is it which brings the ſoule to that happy condition, that lookes after the world and Heaven for God, when the other after God for the world and Heaven; ſo while hee makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33685:65"/>his God, makes himſelfe a devill, while the other in making himſelfe Gods, makes God himſelfe; while he drawes in onely that hee might poure out, God poures in unto them while he is drawing forth, while he takes his graces themſelves drinkes and fills his belly with thoſe living waters to this prime and principall end that the overflowing thereof may make glad the city of God, and carry both himſelfe and it to be ſwallowed up of that infinite ocean of loves and ſweetneſſes. A Chriſtian is (at leaſt, ſhould be) ſo rich with content ſo ſuperaboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with ſuch an exuberancy of the milke and hony of Canaan, that like the diſtended udders of high fed Kine, it even lookes to be drawne forth, and longs for ſome to be taken into the partnerſhip of its joyes and graces; ſo far ſhould he be out of any impotencie and incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of ſpirit to be carried out to the fond deſires of the creature, to pitchupon it as his happineſs. Neither is there any thing I know that doth more raiſe, more innoble the ſoul then this open heartedneſſe, this freeneſſe of ſpirit, nothing that makes it more like God himſelfe, whom it hath, in whom it lives beaming forth the Sunne of its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and beneficialneſſe to all that come within the compaſſe of his Horiſon and (as he hath conveniency) choſes the emptieſt veſſell to communicate his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to, both of graces and common gifts, ſtill like his God that profeſſeth himſefe to delight moſt in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the humbleſt to be in a ſpeciall manner the God of the needy, the fatherleſſe, the widdow the ſtranger, ſo hee ſeekes the moſt indigent object to draw out his ſoule unto, and delights in delighting the comfortleſſe; as he that findes it more bleſſed, more glorious (becauſe more like to, more full of God) to give then to receive.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33685:65"/>As he that is ſtill calling his faith to account, to ſee what it layes out in action. How ſtirring, how operative it is, how it workes by love, whether it love not it ſelfe more then God, whether it be not more for receiving then do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? As knowing it a moſt ſtrongly denying expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, an evident brand of an unbeliever, and that by him who beſt knew how to give every thing its proper mark: How can ye believe which receive honour (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pleaſure, profit, &amp;c.) one of another, and not ſeek for that which commeth from God only. Now what greater honour can there be to a man, then to have his workes beare witneſſe that the Father hath ſent him, to be inabled to doe, to give any thing to God (as he is who does, gives to any in his name) what greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, profit, then to be the ſervant of God, imployed in his buſineſſe, to live in his ſight, to walk before him, to be at his finding? But thoſe miſerable niggardly pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoules, that are unacquainted with theſe inlargings, theſe fully ſatisfying apprehenſions, no marvell they are ſtill raking, ſcraping, and ſcrabling on the Dunghill for rotten rags. Certainly the ſoule that hath ever had any quick, lively, intimate, thorough reſentments of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Loves ſhed abroad in its heart, that hath ever feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly found that God hath not a faithfull induſtrious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who hath not him an indulgent Father, a dearely affecting Husband, an ineſtimable Portion, cannot be baſe, cannot but live at an high rate, as he that knowes the raiſing thoughts of ſo high dignity; cannot but ſpend freely, communicate liberally, munificently, as not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of thoſe Mines, thoſe treaſures inexhauſtibly infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, that are ever ready for his ſupply. Cannot but be mercifull, and lending, while he ſtill guides his affaires
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33685:66"/>with diſcretion, and hath an eye too to that diſcretion, leſt it ſhould befoole him in degenerating into baſeneſſe, and ſlily winde him about into himſelfe, while he is ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying how to outgoe himſelfe in keeping the preciſe, and narrow path preſcribed him. Or rather an eye to it, leſt it be falſe and counterfeit, it being impoſſible for Truth but to be ever like it ſelfe. This is he that cannot effeminate enervate himſelf in delicacies, and pleaſures, while he knowes none but in God, and they flowing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſoule like a ſpring of life, and vigour, that beare him forth in a voluble, diffuſive, indefatigable courſe of activity in well doing, while they ſtill bathe him in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable refreſhings, unimaginable delights. This is not a man that is but the name and ſhaddow of one, while like a brute beaſt he is carried on to eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſleeping, or any naturall deſire, and pleaſure, out of a meere <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>impetus,</hi> and propulſion of Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from ſomewhat to be received from them to himſelfe. But the very doing of theſe obedientially as duties, as ordinances for ſomewhat to be done by them in a way of a further ſelf-emptying and tranſacting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into God, is that which makes this very thing the ſervice of God, when the moſt glorious performances, the moſt publike beneficialneſſe, the moſt pain-taking actions, activity in things materially good, is but ſerving themſelves, and the devill. So that that mans pleaſure is Gods ſervice, becauſe he makes Gods ſervice his pleaſure and this mans paines-taking in the beſt duties is a ſerving the devill, becauſe it is the pleaſing himſelfe; the godly man acting not becauſe it is pleaſing to him, but it is pleaſing to him becauſe it is action, the other contrary; the godly, not that he may get to himſelfe, but that he may get to God (and ſo indeed to himſelfe)
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33685:66"/>counting Gods glory his greateſt good. And therefore imployes himſelfe in that which is moſt ſingular, and eſpecially ſerviceable to God and Gods, and not in that which is moſt profitable to himſelfe, he had rather ſpend thouſands of pounds, of yeares, of any thing in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, then the leaſt penny, the leaſt minute, the leaſt any thing in the ſervice, or (to ſay righter) the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of himſelfe; as he that counteth his pleaſures his works and duties, and his works &amp; duties his pleaſures, the doing of the will of God his meat and drink, and his meat and drink the doing of the will of God. And this were an excellent way to make us humble in excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, temperate in delights, diligent in action, and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding thoſe three conſociating and Nation-deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins, Pride, Idleneſſe, and fulneſſe of Bread. So may we make an eſpeciall uſe of that common by-word, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning and examining our deſires, when they call us to, or put us upon any thing, <hi>What to doc.</hi> And thus Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an I greet thee with that ancient ſalutation <gap reason="foreign">

And indeed our owne, when wee ask one another how wee doe, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another may doe well, imports no leſſe, but that to do well, is to be well. Neither is the deſcription of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health diſagreeable to that of the ſoul, it being ſuch a frame and conſtitution of it, whereby it is fit and ready for the diſcharge of its ſeverall duties, in their right-due maner. So that they deſcribe it not ſo much by its enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf in a ſweet and freſh temperature, reſulting from the well ſymmetrizing of humors, and confermation of parts, as by its right &amp; ready toward lines to requiſite acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So the ſoul then healthy, not ſo much in regard of the joy &amp; comfort that it finds in God, as of the vigor by it, the active diſpoſition, the operativeneſſe towards him.

Grace being the ſpirit of Chriſt working on us, in us, and through us, beginning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, and ending all in it ſelfe; happy Soule that knowes what is the ſtudy of ſelfe-deniall, never can wee finde any where more of ſweetneſſe, becauſe no where more of God. O could we make this our <hi>Hoc age</hi> our buſineſſe, our one thing, whether wud it leade us, where wud it looſe us, even to the following of God fully to be full of him, and ſtill to follow him, to emptie and fill, fill and emptie in a moſt ſweet and bleſſed exerciſe of ſoule till we lay downe in everlaſting reſt and peace, wholly emptied of our old and dying, wholly filled with our new &amp; everliving ſelves! O the unſerchableneſſe, the unconceiveableneſſe of the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord! O the depth of its humility, the heighth of its zeal, the latitude and length of its obedience, what thing, what time can bound it! O what is it can ſo free, can ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large ſo ſublime the heart, as the giving it up to the hands of its God, to be guided by him, at his pleaſure! Can the ſoule contain it ſelfe within it ſelfe, that hath theſe thoughts. O when ſhall we know what it is, that ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, that being but one ſoule, but one heart! When ſhall we be like ſo many cloſing pieces of tender waxe before the fervent heat of the Sun? When ſhall we

But if this ſtation of ſoule bee vergent to either hand, better to ſadneſſe (I meane not of harſhneſſe, diſcontent, or any kind of malignitie, but a more ſolemneſſe, retiredneſſe of ſpirit) then to jollitie, ſlightneſſe, flaſhineſſe, pragmaticalneſſe, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſibodiednes, &amp;c. nothing that I know arguing a man of a more emptie and worthleſſe ſpirit. By the ſadneſſe of the countenance the heart is made better; more pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, more wary, more capable of councell, diligent in action; againe, love is more taking with ingenious, then terrour with baſe and ſervile ſpirits, Gods mercy in Chriſt will ſooner fetch them up, then all his threatnings caſt theſe downe. And indeed a Chriſtian (ſo farre as underſtanding himſelfe, the ground and uſe of his owne affections) cannot but pleaſure in his ſorrow, delight in his mourning in his brokenneſſe, in his contrition of heart, becauſe, delights in doing the will of God, becauſe, he ſees the hand of God working it, feeles it kneading as it were, ſubduing, faſhioning it to his owne mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, his affections are anſwerable to God's, he delights in that which God delights, and further, knowes neither it, nor ought elſe of worth, further then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient, conducible, advantagious to his love, his joy, his confidence in, his magnifying of Chriſt, &amp;c. ſo his joy muſt needs have a touch, a tincture of greefe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he lookes on it as on all his affections, as matter of dutie and obedience (elſe wu'd they not differ from bruit beaſts) becauſe bid rejoyce in the Lord alwayes, againe bid to rejoyce; but now he cannot ſo looke on it, but with a ſweet &amp; gratious regret, to ſee it no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no more pure, that hath ſo infinit ſo holy a God for its object, for its only object, either immediatly, or at leaſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33685:70"/>mediatly. And ſo indeed this very griefe cannot but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, confirme, conſolidate his joy in an humbly-thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (the onely comfortable and truly joyfull) poſture of ſoule, to ſee in what a ſweet and gratious temper the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſſe maintaines it, whoſe rich and abundant mercy it is that it finds any the leaſt ſmatch of true and reall peace. And I am perſwaded, that even in heaven it ſelfe theſe hints and reliſhes of our owne unworthineſſe, made worthy in Chriſt, of ſuch an enmitie reconciled in ſuch a unity, will much further, intend and extend theſe inimaginable joyes. Sure I am they are a heaven upon earth. And this, this onely is the griefe becomming a Chriſtian, that lead'ſt it to the pureſt-and-ſublimed'ſt joyes. Thoſe feares thoſe tremblings that keepe the ſoule in the humbleſt ſelfe-debaſing, and therefore at the higheſt exaltation.</p>

Where the promiſe, precept, word is not taken aright, the application of the ſoule to it muſt needs be amiſſe; where the ground is miſtaken the building muw needs miſcarry. Where that's not ſound this muſt ſinke. Looſe and ſpongie ſoiles may have a firme ſuperficies. Hollow vaults a hard roofe. The ſoule that takes things by the outſide is like to goe away with out-ſide comforts; that is not penetrating, bottom-ſearching, inward-looking, is like to fall low for want of looking low. Build then cauteouſly O my ſoule, tread warily, take heede of the raſhneſſe of fooles (<hi>Eſa.</hi> 32.4.) walke accurately, circumſpectly, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, keepe thy ſelfe cloſe to thy God, loaſe not thy hand, thy hold, the leaſt time, the leaſt diſtance, walke humbly, love him intirely, cleave to him inſeperably, follow him at every turne, thou canſt never be out of thy way while thou keepeſt thy way, thy Chriſt, whom thou ſha't onely find in his fatheas, who is (who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) found of all them that ſeeke his face, (not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but him) his holineſſe his glory; who of his juſt goodneſſe and gratious wiſedome, to the manifeſtation of the power of his light, of his love, hath left thee among ſo many falſe lights, fooles-fires, in ſuch a miſt in ſuch a night of darkeneſſe, among ſo many miſguiding guides like ſo many falſe voices in a wilderneſſe. Now to know his from a ſtrangers, now to diſcerne is grace,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33685:87"/>wiſedome, &amp;c. in its richeſt attire. Reſigne then thy ſelfe to thy Chriſt to thy God, live by faith in all, and feare not but when thou art gone out of thy ſelfe, his ſpirit ſhall teach thee, when, what, &amp;c. to ſee, heare, doe, &amp;c. for while thou art with, ſo farre as thou art with the Creator thou canſt not want wiſedome how to uſe the Creature, ſo as it may bee moſt for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that is the height of thy wiſedome. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo long a wee are with him, hee will bee with us counſelling, directing in all our wayes. All our miſcarriages, ill doing, and ill farings being from our departure from him, our light, life, comfort; ſo that not onely true faith is rationall; in beleeving God beyond and againſt ſence; but true reaſon is faithfull in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with God in and thorough ſence.

I live by the faith, live the life, of the ſon of God. We are dead, and our life is hid with Chriſt in God. ARe dead, and the ſpirit that raiſed up Jeſus quickneth our mortall bodies, the ſoule of our ſoules, the life of our lives. Senſes ſpiritualized. Whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne, &amp;c. Neither can there be any thing pleaſing to God but what is done in him in whom onely he is well pleaſed; but what wee doe in him we doe by faith. The nature whereof were wee ſo happy fully to know, wee ſhould fully know our owne happineſſe.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>
                  <hi>No longer (after my long Vacation in my travells) to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate you of your deſire, though of force I muſt of the thing deſired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FEare I conceive may not unfitly be diſtinguiſhed into a feare of averſion and a feare of adheſion; of turning from and cleaving to; and this may well be ſtupendious, aſtoniſhing, overcomming; in reſpect of the immenſitie of the goodneſſe of its object, ſuch a feare as may be ſayd to <hi>fall upon</hi> the ſoule, and make the ſoule fall under it, in a ſweet God-injoying ſubmiſſive humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litle. Such a feare as one may be ſayd to be <hi>In</hi> the ſeare of the Lord; to be plunged in, ſwallowed up of thoſe great and glorious apprehenſions. This being both the effect and the cauſe of <hi>uniting the heart</hi> to God. And hence is it a feare of ſuch <hi>great joy</hi> and <hi>ſtrong confidence.</hi> The ſoule thus brought into God by <hi>love that is ſtronger then death,</hi> and faith that intereſted in the power, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome goodneſſe of God <hi>can doe all things,</hi> by this ſo neare approach to, and communion with him, diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more of his fulneſſe, and in that of the creatures va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. And hence are they ſo inſeperably linckt together, <hi>men of courage-fearing God-hating covetouſneſſe; fearing the Lord-and Delighting Greatly in his Commandements.</hi> It is raſhneſſe and madneſſe that proceeds not from this feare; it is baſeneſſe and puſillanimitie that ariſeth not from this courage. The joy is ſadneſſe that is not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with this feare; and griefe the more kindly it is the more it hath of this delight. For that other of aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whether reſpecting morall or naturall evills, it is either a bare and ſimple, or a mixt and applicative a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:33685:109"/>eare, a feare of contraction, or of dilatation of the ſpirit, a meere withdrawing and flight, or an aggreſſive reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and repulſion. And either of them is convenient <hi>pro re nata,</hi> as warranted by the conſideration of the thing, time, place, perſon, &amp;c. For morrall evills, it is a feare of abſolute reſiſtance, becauſe they never conſiſt with the will of God <hi>quoad nos;</hi> for naturall it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective reſiſtance, and flying, ſo farre as they ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be his will or not, as we are called or not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them. So that there may be a feare of theſe evils, well conſiſting with a willingneſſe too and deſire of them, as it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>hee was heard in all that hee feared,</hi> and yet againe, <hi>I come to doe thy will as it is written of mee a body haſt thou prepared me, &amp;c.</hi> The ſpirit may be willing when the fleſh is weake. There may be and that lawfully an abhorrencie from evill as evill, and yet a will ingneſſe to it as the will of God, and therefore good. <hi>Father let this cup paſſe from me if poſſible,</hi> but not my will but thy will be done. The prayer of him who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone in his owne perſon ſo freely drunke up that ſo unimaginably terrible cup of the Aeternall wrath, that ſhu'd have beene the portion of an everliving death to ſo many millions of ſoules. And certainly could all the calamities of the world that were ever, are, or ever ſhall be ſuffered from <hi>Adam</hi> to the youngeſt of his ſonnes, ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped like ſo much Gall and Wormewood in one cup till all their ill-ſavoured taſt were extracted from them, they could never make a draught ſo intenſively bitter, ſo large a draught of bitterneſſe, as that which was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, accepted of him, pray'd for by him. To which he <hi>comes,</hi> brings his <hi>body,</hi> as a Voluntier, as ready, as <hi>prepared</hi> for The Service, The Suffering. So in deede ſhould this feare of averſion be ſubordinate to,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:33685:109"/>fall in with, and be comprehended in, as part of, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from and tending to that of adheſion. I therefore turning from evills, becauſe <hi>pro ſua virili,</hi> of their owne nature, it would turne me from God; but ſuch being the never never ſufficiently admired power, wiſedome and goodneſſe of God that he can turne even the greateſt evill to the greateſt good, the ſoule ſtands in <hi>aequilibrio</hi> with a kind of willing unwillingneſſe, or willing willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe diſpoſed to it. So as it may be ſaid not to feare them, but God; fearing them becauſe of him, and him in, by and through them; (as it may be ſaid to love not the creature but God) they being but as foyles and ſet offs for the further illuſtrating the otherwiſe not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Glory. So make the ſoule cleave the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to him and gather more ſtrength from him. So theſe feares differing not in their being and nature, but in the manner of action; both being the feare of God, now act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ad intra,</hi> now <hi>ad extra,</hi> now making good its primary object, now evill its ſecondary. Chriſt, <hi>upon whom were the chaſtiſements of our peace, whoſe ſtripes</hi> hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt us the <hi>ſpirit of a ſound and healthy mind,</hi> who was troubled for our eaſe and tranquilitie; that wee in him poſſeſſed of his fathers alſufficiencie might be of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled mind, having thus, like that unparellel'd Queene to her impoyſoned husband, ſuckt out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, virulencie and malignitie of our feares, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fill us with diſturbance, diſtractions, evill-creating and evill-nouriſhing conceits, over ſtudious, and over burdening preventions. Their deadly qualitie and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſtering power, thus drawne away, and onely ſo much left as is within the ſtrength of inherent and continually ſupervenient grace, and may by it be kept at an under, ſubdued, and worke't out daily to the further manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:33685:110"/>the power of God in us and by us, as well as upon us. The more then we prevaile againſt this diſtempering feare, the more is our convaleſcencie, the greater our recovery of that happy harmony that was betweene our affections before they were untuned in their fall. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affection being ſo farre good as it holds its corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency with the other, and all as they tend to their perfection, action. Good is the griefe the feare that after helpes. A wary, circumſpective, deliberating, confultive prudentiall, providentiall feare. And to this purpoſe was it an anſwer well worthy its Author, that Turkiſh Terrour that even-incredibly valiant <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> to the precipitate and unadviſed adviſe of one of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, <hi>It is good to feare all that may be feared, that ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we may feare nothing.</hi> And ſuch a, and but ſuch a feare is that which is becomming a Chriſtian. Of whom there is nothing more unworthy then baſe derecting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manning (and for ſo much) unchriſtianizing feare. God having <hi>ex conſulto,</hi> and out of a gratious forefight, left our enemies <hi>ſubdutos &amp; expugnatos,</hi> though not <hi>funditus ſtratos;</hi> brought under, overcome, though not utterly ſubverted; that, that in nothing we might bee terrified, this, that in nothing we might be ſecure, laſche, remiſſe, dull, blunt; but might ſtill have them as <hi>Coticulas,</hi> as whetſtones to our mettle, and animoſitie; as thoſe on whoſe fall and ruine wee may bee raiſed to an higher pitch of an unreachable and undaunted ſpirit. As it was well counſelled by that wiſe Statiſt for the ſparing of Carthage from an utter demolition, for the keeping in heart of the Roman valour, that wu'd elſe languiſh i' the want of exerciſe. And God ſometimes (like that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanure of <hi>Edward</hi> the third to the young Prince at
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:33685:110"/>the battle of <hi>Creſey</hi>) withdrawes himſelfe as it were, and ſtands aloofe of, at a convenient diſtance, on the hills of his ſalvation, environed with his auxiliary troopes; and thence viewes us in the valley, how we fight, how we are matcht, how we quit our ſelves with the ſtrength already received, without a more extraordinary recreut, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us often to be brought to hard ſtreſſes, preſſing exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences and almoſt inextricable ſtreights; yea to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry jawes of death, yea to bee ſwallowed up of death; that living and dying Conquerours (like that late-and ever-famous Swead) he may in a more ſpeciall manner ſhare to us with himſelfe the honour of the day; may demonſtrate ours in his owne glory; That wee are the Sonnes of ſuch a Father, and he the Father of ſuch Sons; That we ſhu'd bee ſo honored to bee made the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his power, and hee to be the Maker of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. Now the feare that thus <hi>ſtrengthens us in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>in the power of his might,</hi> and makes us <hi>ſtand faſt, and quit our ſelves like Men in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that workes up the ſoule to ſuch noble and Princely atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that all ſordid &amp; earth-bred-feares fall below it as Lucifer before that pure and ſpotleſſe Light; This is The feare, The feare of the Lord. Which ſince it is a grace, and therefore ſupernaturall, muſt as all other graces being homogenous be conducible to the reſt, and all to an active and ready performance of the good pleaſure of God, So farre therefore as it turmoyles, perplexes, caſts of the hookes, and makes the ſoule that it is not in a fit poſture to turne and winde any way with the firſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of the divine command, ſo farre as it is not a feare of furtherance to, but of hinderance from, our duty, ſo farre is it not a feare of God; not a feare that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:33685:111"/>drawes us to him, but as all our owne feares, from him. And ſo is it extravagant and wandring out of the way of thoſe inſeperable companions the graces, that all joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convey the ſoule to a more ſtrict, cloſe, and intimate fellowſhip with its God. It will therefore be great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to keepe this kind of feares (ſo farre as meerely concerning us and the evils) from our heart, and ſeat it in the head; that it might not take hold of us, but wee of it; we act and command that, not that us; that it may be as a Sword in our hand to defend us, and not as one at our heart to offend us; that while the heart is carryed on with the fulleſt gale of animoſitie and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, boarne up to the braveſt and higheſt reſolves of a magnanimous ſpirit, the head may wiſely plot, and the hands ſeaſonably act. That we may undertake this feare as a voluntary worke, an expedient injunction, and not be overtaken by it as a meere naturall and neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting affection. But thus ſupernaturaliz'd ſpiritualiz'd we doe, wee ſuffer, with delight all the wills of God; looking on them as deſignes, as ordinances, wherein our good is inviolably interwoven with the moſt high glory. So that the horſe ſhould not more neigh to the battle, nor the ſouldier ſhout at the warning Peece, then the heaven-animated ſpirit ſummoned to the Almighty-might-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying encounters, ſprings forth with a nimble and cheerefull alacritie. And certainely there is nothing can <hi>guard</hi> us better againſt baſe &amp; misbeſeeming feares, then the <hi>unſpeakable, unconceiveable peace that rules in the heart,</hi> that is ruled by the feare, that <hi>is moved by the faith of God.</hi> There is nothing that carries up the heart to a more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated pitch of courage and confidence, then a ſelfe-diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent humilitie; a carefull ſerving of Gods providence
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:33685:111"/>in the uſe of all good meanes, with a well-grounded and full reliance on him alone, above and when he pleaſeth without meanes. And undoubtedly what ever the ſelfe conceited world may thinke, the moſt God-fearing, the moſt-mortified, the moſt-meekned-humbled-ſoule is fortified with the trueſt, with the onely true courage: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he onely is with God the onely ſound ground of confidence. And he hath, he onely hath, and that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily the name of a generous man, of a gentleman, who is the compleate, the accompliſht man; furniſhed with <hi>all</hi> vertuous qualifications, though never ſo ſeemingly different. He whoſe gentle, milde, ſelfe-debaſing, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <hi>debonnairete</hi> is armed with the moſt invincible impregnable proweſſe and valour, commanded and drawne forth by a judicious conducture. So the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall denominations of the Latin and Engliſh, meet well; well couched in and accompanied with that primary and all including vertue, in that one word of the French, <hi>un Preud home,</hi> importing (as one may gather from their uſe of it) a man diſcreet and wiſe, a man of fortitude and proweſſe, of a ſweet and gracious comportment, a man of honeſtie, faithfulneſſe, integritie, <hi>rondeur</hi> of minde. All vertue is of choice. And where all is not choſen none is choſen. To ſuffer in any caſe, upon any termes, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie not patience, meakiſhneſſe not meekneſſes a flegmaticke dulneſſe, a ſtoicall ſtupiditie, not a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-taught compoſiture of ſpirit. Neither can the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion of the act argue the privation of the habit: and though the world count them ſheepiſh moapiſh; &amp;c. becauſe they are <hi>the quiet of the land</hi> that <hi>walke ſoftly</hi> in the humilitie of their ſoule, yet preſent them with a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting object, and ſee whether they doe not give it ſutable
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:33685:112"/>entertainment, the ſame command, the ſame ſpirit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wrought in the ſame heart, all requiſite graces; the manifeſtation onely of either accommodated to a fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and drawne forth by a prudent obſervation. And ſince they know not their Genius, no marvell they hold ſo little friendſhip with them, whoſe foundation is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. Little doe they thinke a Chriſitian is ſuch a one, (as ſuch a one he is if not unlike himſelfe) as can bring the Drum and Trumpet in conſort with the Lute and Violl, or could thence gather what they are like to finde, he can make Muſick of all things. As well of the moſt harſh &amp; hidious terrours, as the ſofteſt and ſweeteſt ſounding melodie; can as well play with the moſt fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and wraſtling (ſo the word Pſal. 18.) as the moſt pure-and peaceable diſpoſition. As being he who knowes how to be <hi>in perills often, in wearineſſe, in painefulneſſe, in watchings often, in hunger and thirſt, in faſtings, often in cold and nakednes, beſides his continuall ſympathizing with the Churches;</hi> knowes how to <hi>run through good report &amp; bad report, how to abound and how to want, and how in all to be content;</hi> a moſt bleſſed concord in the ſpirituall eare, the ſpirituall heart! That can <hi>take joyfully the ſpoyling of his goods,</hi> receive <hi>any word</hi> any <hi>precept</hi> of God as <hi>pure-holy-good-and-juſt,</hi> and ſet about the actively, paſſive obedience of it, <hi>in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Happy afflictions that helpe to ſuch an holy joy! O! where! but I forbeare. And if he griefe it is at the want of this cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and thankefull deportment of himſelfe. And this is a higth that wee are carryed up to in the New <hi>Adam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of the Old even in his innocencie. Hee being altogether free from theſe evills, and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing acquaint with theſe evill-conquering comforts.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:33685:112"/>The Almightie wiſedome to the more eminently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceing of his glorious Grace, having thus wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by our fall raiſed us up to an higher, to a permanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to an ever-highly-permanent Station. Strike up then your allarum when you will, you ſhall never carry him by force, but ſhall but rowſe up more ſpirits to man him repell you. As hee is of a harſh rugged rough-hewne proud-cruell, that is not alleviated with a ſweet milde ſmooth temprature; ſo is it an effeminated, flaccid, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, diſpirited, enervated ſoule, that is not quickned not inlivened with courage. That alone being hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall, this feaveriſh. That too dull for action, this is too quicke for councell, for patience, for endurance: But both happily met together in one, in a wiſe, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, actuating ſpirit, like the naturall heate kindly fomented by the radicall moiſture, and duly agitated by the influent and inſite ſpirits, keepe the ſoule in a happy and healthy conſtitution; becauſe in an apt and proxime power for the well performance of its ſeverall functions. Hence (may be it) thoſe Grecian Captaines were ſo well ſeene in Muſicke as in feates of Armes and Philoſophie; as that brave-ſpirited Epimanondas, &amp;c. it being a uſuall cuſtome after their feaſts to have a Lute preſented them to play on. And certainly he is a man of a choice and compleate temperature, that is well made up of a Scholler, Souldier and Muſitian. A head full of diſcreet and ſage knowledge, a heart full of couragious and meeke love, a hand full of indefatigable and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie-overcomming action. Such a head! ſuch a heart! ſuch a hand! That make ſuch a Man! And yet what are all theſe, and were there a thouſand more ſuch ſuches, but meere counterfeit ſpiritleſſe and dead reſemblances of

And now ſince I have ſo inſencibly ſlipt thus far into the nature of this grace, &amp; we know not how ſoon the Lord may ſettle our diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of State and Church; and ſo prevent us with his mercies, and fit us by them, who will never be fitted for them; and it being the Carracter of an ingenious child to feare favours and not to be affrighted with frownes, I will a little draw it forth into that part of it which may be moſt ſutable to thoſe times. It being the nature of it upon the knowledge of God to know nothing elſe great, no more goods then evills. And yet either ſo weake is our knowledge, or ſo ſeldome our acting it (which makes it for ſo farre no knowledge to us) that in thoſe Halcyon dayes have wee moſt neede of the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves and Princelieſt circumſpection, not to have our ſpirits debaſed in <hi>the knowledge of things after the fleſh.</hi> But now to have a ſpeciall care of exerciſing that myſterious, that inheavening art of making <hi>all things become new,</hi> knowing, affecting doing all things under new notions,

               <p>Thus the ſincere heart brings himſelfe and all the world to this all-revealing Sunne; to ſee what they have of him, in whom hee hath approved the onely, and onely fincere-making, excellencies, by that ſingle eye of faith, that ſingles him out as its onely object, as deſiring to ſee nothing but him, at leaſt mediately if not immediately. And though this latter is the way wherein the earneſtly heartie deſires of the ſoule run after the full and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in oyment of God, yet in regard of the frailtie of the fleſh, the weakeneſſe ſlenderneſſe imbecilitie of the intermediate ſpirits that are as the ties and ligaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the foule and the body, and could not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine themſelves without being utterly diſſolved, ſhud they be unintermittedly bent and held up to that exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive intenſiveneſſe whereunto they are wrought by thoſe

So may our ſoules O Lord be inceſſantly continually <hi>devoted to thy feare,</hi> ſo may they be devout even in all their earthly affaires may <hi>ſe devovere</hi> vow themſelves from themſelves, and pay their vowes continually. So may they ever live in thy fight in thy light that they may never depart from thy feare, that they may never more give the lie to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed knowledge &amp; fellowſhip with the light, by walking in the wayes of darknes; but ſhew forth the glory of their father in Heaven, by the reflection of their ſerene ſincere light ſome converſation on earth. And certainly could we ſtand with this <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> this ſtretching forth of the head in an earneſt looking on him, and longing for him, wee ſhu'd have ſuch an aſſuence of light and life breake in upon our ſoules, and ſhine on our wayes, that we ſhu'd walke up and downe like ſtarres ſhot from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, till having dazled the eyes of the world into an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious aſtoniſhment wee ſhu'd remount for ever fixed in our higheſt ſpheare. Now according as our aſpect is on Him, ſo is it alſo to others; if that but oblique, this but dimme and obſcure; but if that perpendicular, this live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and glorious, O that wee were more excellently skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:33685:115"/>in theſe holy optickes; we cu'd not but be in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie, and therefore in Ethicks Oeconomicks, &amp;c. And cu'd we but live ſoberly righteouſly and godlily upon (as we ran not but, cannot chuſe but upon) the ſight of God, avant then falſe lights, falſe comforts for ever, then he that ſhall come will come and will not tarry; for the Lord is certainly waiting to bee gratious to that ſoule that is thus ſtedfaſtly waiting to be guided by him. This indeed being the product the effect of the ſenſe of that. Neither know I any ſuch (if any other) ſincere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſeeking as that <hi>when I thought of</hi> (an abſent) <hi>God I was troubled, and refuſed to be comforted</hi> by any thing but himſelfe, as knowing nothing elſe true comfort. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be ſuch ſeeking but from a true and lively ſaith, not ſuch a waiting but from a ſincere-and-fervent love; therefore not unlikely the Apoſtle (thus intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the nature of theſe graces) tranſlates thoſe paſſages of <hi>Eſaiah</hi> 11.10. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.4. <hi>ſeeke, truſt; waite, love.</hi> Seeking faith and waiting love.

Will he <hi>live the life of faith in the fleſh,</hi> in all ſenſuall things? is <hi>he crucified to the world and the world to him? Is he dead, and this that even his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body lives, is it by the quickning of the ſpirit?</hi> doth hee
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:33685:116"/>walke up and downe the world as a man that hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life nor ſoule, but onely as inlivened as animated hence? is he <hi>ever lifting up his face to God,</hi> that that flood of light and life that thence with ſuch mighty incomes flowes in upon the ſoule, might beare downe before it every thought that exalts it ſelfe againſt the kingdome of the Lord Chriſt, &amp;c. that wholy given over to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſway and guidance of it, wholly caſting it ſelfe into its imbracings, while it lies drown'd as it were in a Sea of loves and ſweetneſſes, in a bleſſed aſtoniſhment and ſtupefaction, it is elevated in the higheſt advancement of life and ſpirits in the Lord of life and glory, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended and <hi>aſcended</hi> to <hi>draw up</hi> with him all that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to him. O were the ſoule wound up to this pitch, and watched at it; and wound up againe if never ſo little ſlipt downe; how might we live! O ſtill ſtill let us <hi>be in</hi> this bleſſed viſion of God with more continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiveneſſe; contracting thence, or rather dilating thoſe Coexiſtant, inherent, eſſentiall, which we call <hi>attributed</hi> ſpecies. Then others beholding the ſtedfaſtneſſe of our faith, could not but there ſee more of that radiant image in its deputed Majeſtie; the ball of the ſenſuall eye not more naturally expreſſing the Idea of the directly oppoſite and neighbouring viſage, then this of the ſpirituall, of faith, doth that of God. And certainly no ſence doth furniſh us with more, and more cleare conceptions of God, then the ſight; being for its ready commence with the ſoule, for its extention, and intention, the propereſt moſt conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and advantagious of all; being the moſt ſpatious, fartheſt reaching, pure, ſimple, active, and therefore moſt apprehenſive: and next to that the hearing, being the leſſe groſſe and earthly of all the reſt. But to keepe to that;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:33685:116"/>As the Sunne conveyeth heate and activitie inſeperably with, and proportionably to its light, ſo is the truth lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and done ſo farre and onely ſo farre as it is ſeene. The actions are ſpurious and illigitimate that are not conceived in the heart and begotten by the eye; it will be our wiſedome then ſo truly to informe the latter at we deſire the well and right forming and performing of the other. Let us <hi>looke on him</hi> then by no other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan then faith, thorough no other medium then Chriſt; at no other diſtance, then the meareſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; even to ſuch an unitie, that wee ſee our ſelves in him and him in us. When with the wicked wee put God farre from us, and ſee the world draw nigh us, then ſeemes he little and this great; but when we draw neere to him, what a pointile, what an atome, what a nothing it ſeemes, nay it is? And as the medium is ever the fame, ſo is the Organ then beſt when moſt refined, abſtracted, metaphyſicall, ſubtilized, ſublimed and ſence-rarified; cauſe then moſt proportionable and ſutable to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie and puritie of the object it intends, and therefore conſequently to the extenſiveneſſe and infinitie of it, God being ſimply infinite and infinitely ſimple. And therefore as wiſedome conſiſts in the cleareneſſe and quickneſſe, ſo in the inlargedneſſe, of the underſtanding; but ſince that knowledge that light in every thing wee draw from him is the onely true wiſedome, wee are then wiſeſt when our underſtandings are moſt clarified by him, moſt acted on him. And ſurely this clarifying of our faith is according to the intimateneſſe of our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bold acceſſe unto him; the nature of this Sunne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give light to the blind, and that more or leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we are more off, or apply our ſelves nearer to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33685:117"/>Him. And ſurely while we thus ſee God in the holieſt of holies, all the kingdomes of the earth in their freſheſt and heart-ſtealingeſt lovelineſſe, and that ſet forth in the moſt rich and glorious accoutrements, will lie at our feete as a dead and rotten carkaſle; ſo farre ſhall we be from committing folly with it; ſo farre, that though then too our ſpirits be at the livelieſt, as they cannot but be, yet becauſe wee, nay therefore becauſe we, be as <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> as <hi>dead</hi> to it, as it is to us. Such power hath this ſight to fill the heart with love, this love to hold the ſoule cloſe to God, from any thing that would part it from him, and to carry it forth in all readineſſe of obedience with him. When contrarily while we are looking on the world without God, we are but looking on ſo many ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities, that dead the heart to reall and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, withholding it from God, and ſetting the hand on worke in the wayes of ſinne; which ſtill eſtrange the ſoule from Him, and keep Him at a diſtance from the ſoule; that more deading the heart, that, &amp;c. ſo the ſoule running on in a round of wickedneſſe, if God not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly breake in, and hinder its courſe. Which when he doth, his preſence makes grace to grow by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable officiouſneſſe of all its undivided parts. The ſight of God inflaming the affections, they inciting to actions, theſe againe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſtirring up the fire in more fervent flames, they giving in greater light, that diſcovering more beautie, that kindling more fire, that animating to more action, this againe, &amp;c. ſo truely infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, infinitely, infinitely ſweet is the comfort of the God-converſing ſoule. The ſoule that hath <hi>received the truth in the love thereof;</hi> and <hi>he that loves mee keepes my Commandements,</hi> &amp; <hi>he that doth my will ſhall know my will;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33685:117"/>he that hath my Commandements</hi> as his poſſeſſion, riches, &amp;c. <hi>and keepes them</hi> as his greateſt joy comfort life, <hi>he it is that loves me and to him will I manifeſt my ſelfe;</hi> Now this manifeſtation againe fills the heart with more opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and effectuall love, this againe, &amp;c. Thus <hi>Faith worketh by love, the fulfilling of the Law, the end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement out of a pure heart and of a good conſcience and of faith unfained;</hi> the ſinceritie whereof muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſight it hath of God, according to the lovelineſſe, worth chooſeableneſſe that it ſeeth in him. Faith then I take to be (by what of light in this night of blindneſſe and darkeneſſe I can ſee) ſuch a light as ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on the intentively beholding ſoule through the face of Chriſt, hath that influence and attractive power with it, to draw it up and make it cleave and adhaere with all its might and ſtrength to God, to lift up the heart to, and make it goe along with him in all his wayes. While like the Helitrophion, it turnes and winds; ſhuts and opens with the motion of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe. And this light thus influenced, thus working (how ever clouded and obſcured to a Chriſtians ſelfe) to be wiſedome unto ſalvation, that effectuall knowledge of God &amp; his Chriſt, comming into, and received of, the ſoule, that is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall already taken hold of, and ere long fully proſſeſſed, or thus,

All graces, how diſtant ſoever ſeeming, being of the ſame company, going the ſame way; ſo that he that is with one, muſt needs be with all. And queſtionleſſe all are wrought in the ſoule together, and grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; how ever in the minoritie of our Chriſtianitie God may teach us <hi>methodo analytica,</hi> may as it were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell them forth into ſeverall leſſons, till our capacities are more widened and ſtrengthned for the fuller and compleater apprehenſion of them, according as wee grow in our manhood in Chriſt Jeſus. And hence is it that ſo often in Scripture a Chriſtian is caracteriſed by one onely; But eſpecially by faith and feare, that in the old, this in the new Teſtament; one, in Chriſt more dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhadowed out, the other in Him more evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, but both in Him: according to the <hi>manifold wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God</hi> in Him by whom Hee hath reconciled all things, the ſeverall kinds of actings of the ſoule as well as ſeverall ſoules to one another, and all to himſelfe. So that what they ſaid of their vertues, that there was <hi>cogna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio quaedam &amp; arcta neceſſitas</hi> betweene them, I am ſure holdeth moſt true of graces; betwixt whom there is

                  <hi>cognatio certa &amp; neceſſitas perquam arctiſſima.</hi> All of the nobleſt and familiareſt conſanguinitie, being all of the blood of Chriſt.

We preach Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> the whole ſum of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell-Law, and Law-giving Goſpell, and conſequently the whole worke of grace being onely Chriſt. So that we cannot ſo much as thinke the leaſt good thought of our ſelves. What we doe, what we have, what we are, of good, we doe, we have, we are not; but it is God, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt that dwells in us, and ſo indeed ours, ſo we, as Chriſtians as outed of our ſelves, as <hi>inned in God, perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the divine Nature, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe being in us habitually, whoſe acting in us, imminently or tranſiently, is all our grace. Now the ſpirit of God is indiviſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are all our graces; homogeneous, harmonious; have a gracefull ſymetrie, analogie, proportion, to one another; make but one ſyſteme, joynt frame, and body of Chriſtianitie; how different ſo ever, how diſcrepant ſoever the parts, the members ſeeme, they are gracefull to, uſefull to each other. Are like ſo many faculties of the ſame ſoule in innocency, before by our fall they were like a watch daſhed againſt, troubling and ſtopping the courſe of one another. Which mended againe by their maker, though like ſeverall wheeles they ſeeme to move not onely diverſly but contrarily, yet are they all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Though God often times, (ſpecially in the more powerfull times of the Goſpell) brings forth Chriſt formed, as it were without any paine, tunes the heart as it were with one touch, and ſets up the whole and joynt frame of the temple, without ſcarſe any the leaſt ſound of the hammer.) And as a wheele, not onely by, but in its going downe, is <hi>Ipſo facto</hi> going up, ſo thoſe graces that ſeeme onely to caſt downe the ſoule, doe not onely afterward, but in the very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, raiſe it up; as humilitie, feare, griefe, &amp;c. which ſo farre as divine, and as I may ſay Goſpell-proofe, are ſtill rayſing up the ſoule in the greater aſſurance, magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie, joy, and theſe (as it were) ſtill caſting it downe, and that againe rayſing it up, &amp;c. As there is nothing that more humbles the ſoule then heavenly mindedneſſe, ſo is there nothing that more ſublimes it then humilitie; as there is nothing that ſtrikes the ſoule with a deeper awe then the aſſurance of the eternall love, ſo in the feare of <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the ſtrongeſt confidence; as it is an unſound and vaine joy that hath no acquaintance with ſorrow, ſo is it a ſinfull and death-working ſorrow that reares not up the ſoule to more livelmeſſe and joy, &amp;c.

Or had we obſerved, that it is with Chriſtians as with the tenent and morteſſe in building, the condyles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities in the bones of the body; he is that eminent at one end (as it were) may be defective at the other, that is excellent in this, may be wanting in that; that ſo wee may fall in with, joyne cloſer to one another in one &amp; the ſame building frame and growing body; ſo farre ſhould we be from making them as arguments to keepe us at

What puritie of conſcience, what life of aſſection, I ſee in the converſation <hi>(caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus)</hi> by that ſhall I judge of the truth of the meaſure of the faith, the knowledge, as the roote by the fruit; and by that I look to be judged by the judge of all things; by him whoſe <hi>call</hi> is <hi>for,</hi> whoſe <hi>reſidence</hi> is <hi>in,</hi> whoſe <hi>ſhining</hi> is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the heart,</hi> where he ſhewes himſelfe, where he is, where he ha's ſavingly.

That which ſounds forth God in its life, and not that which founds forth it ſelfe in its tongue. The Divill I beleeve hath as much knowledge, and can dictate as excellent diſcourſe, as all the men of the world. Knowledge, ſo farre as it is not cordiall and living, ſo farre as it is not ſappy ſavory and fruitfull, but dry and barren, or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth wild thiſtles, ſo farre I ſhall never thinke it to have the Lord Chriſt for its roote.

No, when we <hi>fall into</hi> them, when we tumble as it were headlong into the pit, whence there is no eaſie or ſuddaine riſing.

Who in that he is God cannot but give ſafe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, who in that he is good cannot but give all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and requiſite protection, to all that truly come in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

For indeed what of delight is there in any of theſe worldly things we call good, as health wealth, &amp;c. Which from him they have not, or without him can have. There is, there is ſurely nothing in them of themſelves, but vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

               <p>MY neare and deare friend in the Lord Jeſus, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but according to your deſire acquaint you with preſent paſſages; and paſſages I may well ſay, for all theſe things are but paſſing ſhadowes, nothing. Were we in our own place, we might look down upon them as little fleeting vapoury clouds, without raine. Or elſe ſee our ſelves ſo far above them in this third region, as wee need not feare the ſtorme. It is unworthy the thought of a Chriſtian that hath already <hi>laid hold of eternall life,</hi> to ſhrink at the appearing loſſe of a mortall. But we are men. But God is God. And he is <hi>our own God, the God of our ſalvation, &amp;c.</hi> O that we could, that we alwayes could ſee our ſelves <hi>ſo partakers of the divine nature, ſo filled with all the fulneſſe of God,</hi> that we could look upon life and death, principalities, powers, &amp;c. as things gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in unto us, and all as things under our feet, at our command; for ſo they are to him that beleeves, for <hi>all are ours, and we are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> Our faith muſt fall before we, and our God before our faith. For it is founded on that rock, that living ſtone, that is the life of all the building. Let us ſtand therefore having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us unto the whole armour of God, for what can the man doe that comes after the devill? And ſurely little, nay no cauſe have we to feare in adverſity, that can ſtand in proſperity. That ſoule, and only that ſoule that in this eſtate can <hi>follow God fully,</hi> be ſo ſatisfied with the hourely, minutely preſence of God, that in all things it croſſes it ſelfe of its own will, as not enduring the leaſt
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:33685:126"/>eſtrangement from him, certainly in the other the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God ſhall ſo follow him, ſo ſhall he delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe continually in him, as that in all things hee will croſſe men and devils of their wills againſt him, and ſo over-powre him with the light of his countenance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he was dead in the deareſt injoyments, and with which he lives in the deadlieſt confuſions) as ſhall make them gnaſh their teeth to ſee ſuch a divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect from that light unſpeakable and glorious, whereby he ſhall be able to laugh death and deſtruction in the face. But ſhall we not feare, not grieve? He is no true Chriſtian that doth not. <hi>Shall the Lion roare, and we not tremble?</hi> Yet muſt we be confident in this feare, and joy in this ſorrow. And indeed the feare of God is ſtrength, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.1. with ver. 7. and 8.) And by the humility of our heart is our truſt in the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.25. But audaciouſneſſe and pride will ſhrinke in the wetting. Neither will <hi>James</hi> his joy, 1.2. hold good without <hi>Pauls</hi> ſorrow. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.7. Nor his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row without his joy. It is not the exceſſe of feare and griefe, but the defect of confidence and joy that hurts us. Our own weakneſſe can never too much fright us. Our own and others ſins grieve us. Neither will it be found ſo proper and ſoveraign a ſalve to thoſe happily languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſciences, to tell them they are too much dejected, caſt down, ſorrowfull; but rather they have too little lifted up Chriſt in their hearts, and their hearts in Chriſt. It is impoſſible to think too baſely of our ſelves (and if there may be degrees in impoſſibility) more impoſſible to think too highly of Him. When we are led back by any particular ſin to the Originall ſource of all (as wee muſt if we mean to know it to any purpoſe) and ſee the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:33685:127"/>horrid ſhape of it, and become ſenſible of the malignity, the univerſality, the inherencie of it, &amp;c. with all thoſe infinite (as to us) actuall breakings out of rebellion from it, or rather the divers kinde of breaking out of one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unintermitting act; now while the ſoule is thus taking a bottome-and through-ſearching view of it ſelfe, by a beame of the divine Light and Love ſhed abroad in its heart (without which it could make no through, no true diſcovery of it) and thereupon throwes it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the loweſt hell, in a ſenſible ſelf-condemning, while it is ſtill held up by the hand of faith in an unſpeakably bleſſed diſtraction; now to ſee this Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſtill riſing, and riſing with its infinite-ſurpaſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſſe of glory, ſplendor, lovelineſſe upon the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>transformed ſoule, lying under the gracious droppings of its healing wings, O how ſweet is that healing! How, how glorious that Sun! But the ſeeing, the feeling ſoul, where is it? How high! how low! How loſt between both! Be then as ſorrowfull my ſoule as may be, thou canſt not be enough for ſin. As joyfull as may be, thou canſt not be enough for grace. Abate not of that ſorrow, but increaſe this joy. Goe as low as thou canſt, but bee ſure thou riſeſt higher by it. To be ſo dejected and caſt down, as not to be heightned, raiſed by it, in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the love, the life of thy Saviour, is indeed to have proud and haughty thoughts of thy ſelfe, and low and undervaluing of thy Chriſt. Never feare thy livelineſſe and cheerfulneſſe ſo far, as duely objected on him. Nor leſſen ſo much thy love to the creature, as augment it to Him thy Creator. Affect with the ſtrongeſt and heartieſt indearement any thing beſide him, and yet abhorre it with the moſt deteſting and abominating hatred for him.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:33685:127"/>There is nothing that I ſet my eye on that I wu'd not love as proceeding from him, as ſubſiſting in him. But ſo far as degenerate from him, as comming in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, the indignation wherewith it affects me is inutterable. Thus ſhall Ceſar beſt have his due, and God his: Himſelf, and what is ſubordinate to him. God takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way no affection no nor the intenſiveneſſe of it, but onely its obliquitie to the object. Nay I am perſwaded that all worldly feare, all worldly ſorrow fall farre ſhort of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; the one being from a diſpleaſing world which is finite, the other from a diſpleaſed God who is infinite. But how great then is that conſident joy to which this fearing griefe is but a ſet off? For theſe to overcome the ſoule and them for Chriſt to come and overcome that conqueſt what a triumph will there be? Oh the depth of the riches both of the wiſedome and knowledge of God, &amp;c. And bleſſed, ever bleſſed be our God that we are not of them from whom hee hath hid the miſtery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe! ſtrength made perfect in weakeneſſe, concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding diſcord. And if it be the glory of God to bring light out of darkeneſſe, good out of evill, how can we but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that by being ſubjects of the one we come to bethe inſtruments of the other, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5. And if good be the object of the concupiſcible facultie, why ſhu'd we make our affections the object of our iraſcible. The Lord ſtrengthen us with joy in the inner man, and then goe it how it will with the outer. So may we gladly keepe the word of his patience in the ſaddeſt and patience-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaultingſt times; ſo ſhall hee keepe us from, or at leaſt in, and therefore from, the houre of temptation that ſhall come upon all the world to try them. Now is it a time for the patience of the Saints, for them that keepe the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:33685:128"/>Commandements of God and the faith of Jeſus: Now is it a time for thoſe that have held faſt this inviolable knot in the bond of love, to hold up their heads in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, as then knowing the greater redemption drawes nigh when the greater calamitie approaches. Thus what ever of <hi>theſe things we may know already</hi> (feelingly in the heart, if not notionally &amp; perſpicuouſly in the head) <hi>let us not faile to put one another alwayes in remembrance. Alwayes ſtriving together in our Prayers, and that with no ſmall conflict of heart that we may be comforted, being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the miſtery of God, and the Father, and of Chriſt.</hi> Had we more godly and brotherly love, wee ſhould have more comfort, and that would hunger after more knowledge, and that fill with more aſſurance, and that furniſh with more grace, and all acknowledge the miſtery of the puritie, of the wiſedome, of the love of the Godhead. So much ſpirit ſo much faith, ſo much faith ſo much Chriſt, ſo much Chriſt ſo much love, ſo much love ſo much knowledge, ſo much knowledge ſo much fulneſſe of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16. &amp;c. Come then what may come, befall what may befall to the fleſh: The Lord be with, the Lord will be with, will be, our Spirits.</p>
